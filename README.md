## Description 
Here I have recorded a video of this repo of code working using mongoDB and Mongoose package to test API CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete).

## Installation 

If you have a clone of this repo, running `npm i` in the terminal should give you the nescessary files and then `npm start`  should run the server.js file on port 3001! 

## Usage 

The usage for the code in this repo is for a beginner to understand how to interact with a no SQL database, and run API routes to a hypothetical socialmedia databse.
